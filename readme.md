QuickConf
=========
1.1 - What is QuickConf?
---
QuickConf is a Unity-addon which aids the developer to manage their player-settings more easily.  
This was initally planned to be just a tool for changing the sound-volumes more easily, and it expanded into this.  
1.2 - Your code is ugly!
---
I know, I know. At least it works, and is mostly bug-free. Sorry for the lack of comments.
1.3 - I want to help!
---
Great!  
1.4 - Thank me.
